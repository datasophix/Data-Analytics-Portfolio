# Data-Analytics-Portfolio
This contains a personal project that I have accomplished using MySQL, Spreadsheets, and Looker Studio. The Datasource I used was a Netflix Userbase from Kaggle. In this project, I cleaned up raw CSV file using Spreadsheet to be imported to MySQL to perform a series of queries. Moreover, the the final CSV file was also used to create an interactive dashboard.
